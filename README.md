This project is the culmination of a master's program, focusing on the development of a robust system for detecting hate speech in Arabic dialects, with a particular emphasis on the Algerian dialect. The project leverages Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve its objectives.
