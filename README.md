# Hate Speech Detection in Arabic Dialects With Focus On Algerian Dialect
This project is the culmination of a master's program, focusing on the development of a robust system for detecting hate speech in Arabic dialects, with a particular emphasis on the Algerian dialect. The project leverages Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve its objectives.

# Project Overview

The development process includes:

Preprocessing Pipeline:
Creating an effective preprocessing pipeline to address the unique challenges posed by the Algerian dialect.

Machine Learning Baselines:
Developing machine learning baselines using various text representation techniques such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec skip-gram.

Deep Learning Models:
Building deep learning models with different word embeddings like fastText and AraVec.

Fine-Tuning LLMs:
Fine-tuning seven large language models (LLMs) to improve detection accuracy.
